The tests with unit testing seem to be a way of checking data in a very large program by an easy method. I'm not certain how its meant to be used to actually test data that you don't know the anwser to as after deleting the self.assertEqual and changing the values; the program doesn't have anything to compare it to and thus considers the test successfull. I did read in the tutorial that it is important to test your own data repeatably until errors like that are found, then set the self.assertEqual values. But I don't understand why that is nesseccary if you've rigourously tested your data to the point of finding those reoccuring problems. Wouldn't it be better to fix them? 

Or is it's purpose to document and hold current problems with a very large program and then after an update recheck those values to see if they've been fixed. That I could see it being useful for.
